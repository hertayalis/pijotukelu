During his career spanning more than three decades, he was a marquee weatherman for some of the major television networks in the United States. He spent most of his long career with the ABC Network on WABC-TV and also on&nbsp;<i>Good Morning America</i>.&nbsp;He also worked for The Weather Channel, where he was an editor and anchor on shows like&nbsp;<i>AMHQ: America’s Headquarters</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>23.5 Degrees with Sam Champion</i>.&nbsp;The multi-award-winning weather anchor also worked for NBC.</p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Sam Champion</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was born Samuel James Champion in 1961 on August 13.&nbsp;He was born in the town of Paducah in McCracken County, Kentucky.&nbsp;There is not much information about his mother Sylvia, however, his father, James H. Champion, is said to have been a US Marine who served in the Vietnam War.&nbsp;Sam grew up alongside a brother, a sister named Teresa.&nbsp;For his high school education, he attended Fairfax High School in Fairfax, Virginia, where he graduated in 1979.</span></p><p><span>Sam Champion was college educated at Eastern University of Kentucky where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Broadcast News.&nbsp;During his undergraduate studies, he had the opportunity to intern at a local television station, WKYT-TV, in Lexington, Kentucky.&nbsp;His first job after graduating was at WPSD-TV, located in his hometown of Paducah, Kentucky.&nbsp;His next job was with WJKS, based in Jacksonville, Florida.</span></p><p><span>In 1988, he was hired as a weatherman on WABC-TV, a flagship ABC station in New York.&nbsp;This marked the start of a very successful 18-year period in which he easily became the most watched meteorologist in the region.&nbsp;He joined ABC&nbsp;</span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>&nbsp;and ABC News in August 2006, which allowed him to extend his tenure with the network for another seven years.</span></p><p><span>During his time with the ABC network, Champion also appeared on other popular talk shows like&nbsp;</span><i><span>Live with Kelly and Ryan</span></i><span>&nbsp;on WABC-TV and&nbsp;</span><i><span>Larry King Live</span></i><span>&nbsp;on CNN.&nbsp;He was eventually replaced by Ginger Zee on&nbsp;</span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>&nbsp;when he left the network in December 2013.</span></p><p><span>Sam Champion joined The Weather Channel in January 2014. Apart from his role as the channel’s editor, he also co-anchored the morning show.&nbsp;</span><i><span>AMHQ: America’s Headquarters</span></i><span>&nbsp;alongside Mike Bettes and Maria LaRosa.&nbsp;His duties as co-host lasted&nbsp;</span><i></i><span>from March 2014 when the show debuted until September 2015. He began contributing to primetime programs on The Weather Channel after his release from&nbsp;</span><span>AMHQ</span></p><p><span>In March 2016, Champion was featured on his late night talk show titled&nbsp;</span><i><span>23.5 Degrees with Sam Champion</span></i><span>&nbsp;on the Weather Channel.&nbsp;He hosted several episodes of the series until December 2016, when his contract with the channel expired.&nbsp;He then left Weather Channel as his contract was not renewed.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Sam Champion gay, who is the husband?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sam Champion is an openly gay man and has been married for several years.&nbsp;He got married to Rubem Robierb on December 21, 2012, after several years together.&nbsp;Both are known to be very active LGBT activists.&nbsp;Robierb is a Brazilian visual artist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sam Champion’s net worth stands at a whopping $10 million.&nbsp;Apparently, the veteran weather-years presenter has enjoyed sky-high paychecks during his long and distinguished career.&nbsp;He reportedly earned up to $1.5 million a year during his time at ABC.&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hello America</span></i></p><h2><strong><span>Where is he now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sam Champion was unable to grab a mainstream television hosting role soon after leaving The Weather Channel.&nbsp;This certainly contrasted with his previous experiences of changing jobs.&nbsp;However, he reported that the 2017 hurricane season for NBC News and MSNBC led to speculation that he might join NBC.&nbsp;In February 2018, he then returned to his former employer’s ABC network, where he served as a backup weather forecaster on&nbsp;</span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>.&nbsp;Given his level of expertise and immense professional experience, it’s only a matter of time before he returns to television.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirkaJ6pLTApqeip55ir6q7jKecrWWZqHqpsYygmLJlp528tHnHrqqbmZ6Zeri0xKucZqGjYrWmec2ormg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsam-champion-bio-net-is-he-gay-whos-husband-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsam-champion-bio-net-is-he-gay-whos-husband-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsam-champion-bio-net-is-he-gay-whos-husband-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsam-champion-bio-net-is-he-gay-whos-husband-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsam-champion-bio-net-is-he-gay-whos-husband-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsam-champion-bio-net-is-he-gay-whos-husband-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sorsha-morava.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sorsha-morava.html>Sorsha Morava</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rozzah-net-worth-317116.html>Rozzah Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rozzah-net-worth-317116.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
