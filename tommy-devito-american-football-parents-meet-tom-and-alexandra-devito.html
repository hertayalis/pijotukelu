Tommy DeVito was born to Tom and Alexandra DeVito. Tom is Italian however Alexandra is from Germany.</p><p>Growing up in Cedar Grove, New Jersey, DeVito attended Don Bosco Preparatory High School. During his high school years, he displayed his football prowess, earning recognition as a first-team All-State athlete by MSG and second-team All-Metro. In his junior season, he passed for an impressive 1,800 yards and 18 touchdowns, contributing significantly to his team’s successful 9-3 record and their Non-Public 4 state championship victory.</p><p>DeVito’s football talent caught the attention of many, and he solidified his position by participating in the prestigious Elite 11 quarterback competition, where he reached the status of a finalist. As a senior in high school, he continued to impress, amassing 2,005 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and a mere five interceptions. His outstanding performance earned him a place in the Under Armour All-American Game. DeVito had his pick of colleges, but he decided to commit to Syracuse at the end of his junior year, turning down offers from schools like Yale, Boston College, Penn, Rutgers, Maryland, and Temple.</p><p>At Syracuse, DeVito began his collegiate journey. He redshirted his true freshman season, allowing him to develop his skills and adapt to the college game. As a redshirt freshman, he primarily served as the backup to the starting quarterback, Eric Dungey. DeVito saw action in eight games during this season, completing 44 of 87 passes for 525 yards and four touchdowns.</p><p>DeVito’s true moment to shine came in September 2018 when he stepped onto the field against Florida State after Dungey suffered an injury. He showcased his capabilities by completing 11 of 16 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown while also rushing for a touchdown, contributing to Syracuse’s victory. He repeated this feat in October, taking the helm when Dungey was injured and leading Syracuse to a thrilling double-overtime victory against North Carolina.</p><p>In his redshirt sophomore season, DeVito continued to make strides, amassing 2,360 passing yards and 19 touchdowns while also contributing as a rusher with 122 yards and two touchdowns. Although Syracuse experienced challenges during the season, DeVito’s performances were commendable.</p><p>His collegiate journey at Syracuse took an unfortunate turn in 2020 when a leg injury cut his season short after only four games. Despite this setback, he started his redshirt senior season as Syracuse’s first-string quarterback but was later replaced by transfer quarterback Garrett Shrader. Six weeks into the season, DeVito entered the NCAA transfer portal, seeking new opportunities elsewhere.</p><p>He found those opportunities at the University of Illinois, where he became the starting quarterback. DeVito’s impact on the field for the Fighting Illini was felt immediately, and he displayed his versatility with three rushing touchdowns in a game against Wisconsin. During the 2022 season, he showcased his passing skills, amassing 2,650 yards, 15 touchdowns, and four interceptions, in addition to six rushing touchdowns.</p><p>DeVito’s journey from the college gridiron to the NFL came to fruition when he was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent on April 29, 2023, following the conclusion of the 2023 NFL Draft. His early days with the Giants were marked by hard work and determination, which earned him a spot on the practice squad after being waived on August 29, 2023.</p><p>DeVito’s dream of playing in the NFL became a reality on October 29, 2023, when he made his debut in a game against the New York Jets. His opportunity came after an injury to the Giants’ starting quarterback, Tyrod Taylor. Though his performance included just two completions out of seven pass attempts and two sacks, he managed to score the Giants’ only touchdown of the game with a six-yard run.</p><p>NFL Career Statistics: As of his debut, DeVito’s NFL career statistics include one game played with two completions out of seven pass attempts, gaining -1 yard and a 39.6 passer rating. In this game, he also recorded four rushing attempts for 12 yards.</p><p>Thomas N. DeVito’s journey from high school to the NFL is a testament to his perseverance, dedication, and passion for the game of football. His collegiate career, marked by notable stints at Syracuse and Illinois, prepared him for the challenges of professional football, and his debut with the New York Giants is just the beginning of what promises to be an exciting NFL career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading></h2><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2mpqWpYrGmwsitpmaZnZq%2Fqq%2FAp2Sfp5%2Bpr6K4y2anmqqVo8G0ecyenK1lpKS6bq3NnWSapJWtrq%2Bw0ZpknZ2mnsGwew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftommy-devito-american-football-parents-meet-tom-and-alexandra-devito.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftommy-devito-american-football-parents-meet-tom-and-alexandra-devito.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftommy-devito-american-football-parents-meet-tom-and-alexandra-devito.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftommy-devito-american-football-parents-meet-tom-and-alexandra-devito.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftommy-devito-american-football-parents-meet-tom-and-alexandra-devito.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftommy-devito-american-football-parents-meet-tom-and-alexandra-devito.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./19-5-cm-to-feet-and-inches.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./19-5-cm-to-feet-and-inches.html>19.5 cm to feet and inches</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./queen-camilla-son-tom-parker-bowles-modern-home-photo.html>Queen Camilla's son Tom Parker Bowles' home is so unexpected</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./queen-camilla-son-tom-parker-bowles-modern-home-photo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
