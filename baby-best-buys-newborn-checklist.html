Yes, it's great to be prepared but I'd skip buying those expensive items, like a breast pump or a baby formula prep machine, until you need them. I bought a handheld breast pump to see me through (I didn't end up needing to buy a mechanical breast pump) and I used the ready made formula once my daughter moved onto it, before ordering a prep machine on next day delivery.</p><p id=ejTAQLYxWZR data-wc=24>Smaller items, like dummies and milk bottles, won't break the bank and might be worth keeping on hand for those just in case moments.</p><p id=e2M8UfUO38F data-wc=46>Not surprisingly, it's the less glamorous things you'll find you need immediately; plenty of babygrows, nappies, nappy cream, wipes and muslins (the more the merrier) are some of the most pressing things you'll need, along with a baby monitor, mini first aid kit and baby thermometer.</p><p id=eOAlsLvRU_u data-wc=40>Moving onto bathtime, get yourself a baby bath, gentle baby bubble bath and shampoo along with a hooded towel.

Unlike other car seats, a Doona has foldable wheels, which means it can go from car seat mode to stroller mode in seconds, so there's no need to pack a buggy in your boot when you're out and about.</p><p>The Doona X, which comes in Dusty Sage, Ocean Blue, and Nitro Black, has three recline positions including a near flat lie (or full recline) mode, making it a comfortable ride for your little one. It's suitable for infants from 40 to 85cm in height and up to 13 kg in weight.</p><p>And for when your newborn isn't quite so little, they'll have plenty of fun sitting up in the brand's Liki Trike. The latest model, suitable from ten months to three years, is the smallest folding trike on the market and can easily fit in the boot of a car or can be folded down to go in a plane's overhead bin.&nbsp;</p><p><b data-stringify-type=bold>HELLO! Tried and Tested:</b></p><p><b data-stringify-type=bold>"</b>The Doona is one of my most recommended life-saving, newborn products. As a car seat, it's super easy to install, and can convert into a stroller in seconds, which means if your baby is napping in the car, you can easily leave them in the Doona when you get to your destination and unfold the wheels, turning the car seat into a mini buggy. So no risky transfers needed, ever!</p><p>"We used our Doona until our daughter was around 15 months old and always took it on holiday, so there was never any need to hire a car seat or worry about getting a taxi but then not having a car seat to put her in.</p><p>"Because it's so nifty and small too, I would often use it as my regular buggy when she was a newborn, to pop to the shops or get on public transport. It's so much lighter and easier to carry, especially if you're travelling alone."</p><p><b data-stringify-type=bold><a data-sk=tooltip_parent data-stringify-link=https://www.hellomagazine.com/author/ainhoa-barcelona/ href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainhoa Barcelona</a></b><b data-stringify-type=bold>, Content Managing Editor</b></p><p class=AffiliateArticleIndex_a1l5npwy><span class=AffiliateArticleIndexCurrent_an3tpj5>16</span><span class=AffiliateArticleIndexTotal_a1trfdnq>/21</span></p><h2 class="AffiliateProductArticleTitle_a1wx4xtc hm-heading">Mini First Aid Kit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d21eeff4b13-mini-first-aid-kit.jpg><p class=AffiliateProductArticleProsConsTitle_a1osl6fn></p><p>A first aid kit is an essential buy that’s there for when you need it as your child grows up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HELLO!
