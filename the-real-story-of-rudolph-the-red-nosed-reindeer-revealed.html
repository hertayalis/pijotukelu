His wife, Evelyn, was bedridden, on the losing end of a two-year <a href=#>battle with cancer</a>. This left Bob to look after their four-year-old daughter, Barbara.”</p><p>Though the post claims May wrote the story for young Barbara as a way to explain why her mother “wasn’t like other mommies,” May himself wrote in 1975 that Rudolph was actually based more on himself than anyone else.</p><p>In January 1939, Robert May was a copywriter at the Montgomery Ward department store.</p><p>Decades later, in the Dec. 22, 1975, issue of the Gettysburg Times, he wrote, “As I hurried on my way to work, I noticed the Christmas Street decorations had been taken down and in a way, I was relieved.”</p><p>Because of his wife’s illness, May wasn’t feeling festive, he wrote.</p><p>There was more about May’s glumness.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A viral post on the “Old Time Christmas Memories” Facebook group lifts the curtain on backstory behind Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Robert May’s wife, Evelyn, was losing her battle with cancer, leaving all the child-rearing responsibilities to him. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“<a href=#>Here I was heavily in debt</a> at age 35 and still grinding out catalog copy. Instead of writing the great American novel as I’d once hoped, I was describing men’s white shirts. It seemed I’d always be a loser.”</p><p>But fate, and an idea for a “loser” reindeer with a giant red nose, were about to change everything.</p><p>On that very day, May’s boss asked to see him.</p><p>May was charged with the task.</p><p>The reindeer was chosen, he said, for Barbara — who loved the deer at the zoo.</p><p>The idea for the red nose, he said, came to him later.</p><p>“Outside the fog swirled from Lake Michigan dimming the street lights. Something had to help Santa on a night like this,” May wrote in the piece.</p><p>“Suddenly, I had it! A nose! A bright red nose that would shine through fog like a flood light!”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The deer was chosen for his daughter, Barbara, who loved the animal. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>He named his soon-to-be world-famous reindeer Rudolph.</p><p>The boss wasn’t sold on the red-nosed reindeer right away. But after he saw an illustration by May’s friend Denver Gillen — that changed.</p><p>May started writing.</p><p>“Spring slipped into summer,” May wrote, adding that his wife Evelyn’s condition worsened.</p><p>Then, in July, “she was gone.”</p><p>The boss told May it was understandable if he didn’t want to continue the project.</p><p>“But I needed Rudolph now more than ever,” he wrote.</p><p>“Gratefully I buried myself in the writing. Finally, in late August, it was done.”</p><p>He read the story to Barbara and to his wife’s parents.</p><p>“In their eyes I could see the story had accomplished what I had hoped,” he wrote in the Gettysburg Times.</p><p>“Today children all over the world read and hear about the little deer who started out in life as a loser just as I did,” May said.</p><p>“But they learn that when he gave himself to others, his handicap became the very means by which he achieved happiness.”</p><p>May died in 1976, according to the Smithsonian Institute website.</p><p>It added that 2.4 million copies were given away in the first year of the book’s sale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtma2xfobansdKtsKWdX6m1pnnRnpilZaOpvLPFjKidZqqlmbytvMdmq6GdXaeypXnNqKqenF2nsqq6w56cq2WimsOmrcuem2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-real-story-of-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-real-story-of-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer-revealed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-real-story-of-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-real-story-of-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-real-story-of-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-story-of-rudolph-the-red-nosed-reindeer-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nara-smith-real-age.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nara-smith-real-age.html>What Is Nara Smith's Real Age?
