There is no need to be concerned, as we have you covered. Joy Taylor is the woman in question. She is one of the industry’s most prominent female sports anchors.</h3><h3>Indeed, Taylor is currently one of the best television show hosts. However, Joy did not achieve her popularity overnight. Other than that, Taylor has steadily ascended to the top.</h3><h2>What is the Salary & Net Worth of Joy Taylor?</h2><p>Joy Taylor&nbsp; has a net worth of $100,000 as of 2021, which she earned mostly through her television and radio industry work. While her net worth appears to be modest, she has only been working with major networks for four years.</p><p>Additionally, Taylor receives an annual salary of $100,000 as a Fox Sports analyst. To be clear, she serves as the news anchor for Fox Sports 1’s hit show, The Herd with Colin Cowherd.</p><p>Joy has also served as a moderator on Fox Sports 1’s Skip and Shannon: Undisputed.</p><p>However, the television host has been mum about her financial situation. Her possessions, such as vehicles, apartments, and so forth, are unknown.</p><h2>Joy Taylor was born on what date? Childhood and Siblings</h2><p>Joy Allison Taylor was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 17, 1987, to Georgia and Anthony Taylor. Similarly, Joy is an American by race but of white racial origin.</p><p>Joy showed signs of becoming a media personality from an early age, as she spent the majority of her time interviewing and conversing with her two brothers, Jason Taylor and Noah Taylor.</p><p>Taylor later earned a degree in broadcast communications from Barry University during her college years.</p><p>Additionally, the Pennsylvania native served as the host and manager of Barry University’s radio station during her tenure at the university.</p><p>Jason, Joy’s older brother, is a former National Football League defensive end and outside linebacker. He played in the league from 1997 to 2011. The Miami Dolphins selected the athlete 73rd overall in the 1997 NFL draft.</p><p>Jason, likewise, spent his entire career with the team from 1997 to 2007, 2009, and 2011. During his tenure there, young Jason was named to the Pro Bowl six times and was named to the First Team All-Pro three times.</p><p>Similarly, he was named Defensive Player of the Year in the league once and AFC Defensive Player of the Year twice.</p><p>Jason has since retired and has been inducted into the National Football League’s Pro Football Hall of Fame. Additionally, he was named to the NFL 200s All-Decade Team.</p><h2>Joy Taylor’s age is unknown. Age, Height, and Body Dimensions</h2><p>Taylor is currently 34 years old, which is very young for a prominent television show anchor. Indeed, other hosts in her place have been in the business for decades, demonstrating her ability.</p><p>Additionally, she was born under the Capricorn zodiac sign. And, based on what we know, this sign is known for its vigilance, creativity, and competitiveness.</p><p>Joy is 5 feet 6 inches (168 cm) tall and weighs about 95 kilograms. She has a curvy body with a 37-chest, 27-waist, and 38-hips measurement.</p><p>Additionally, Joy now sports radiant blue eyes and black hair styled in a bob-cut. In some ways, it perfectly frames her face, enhancing her appeal.</p><h2>Professional life</h2><p>Joy began her professional career in sports journalism with 790 Am The Ticket before moving to Fox and achieving fame and fortune. Taylor began as an executive producer but ultimately became the co-host of their number one-rated show, Zaslow and Joy Show. She later made cameo appearances on the CBS Sports website and hosted Fantasy Football Today and Thursday Night Live. Then she came across Fox, which was looking for a host with a great personality and a breadth of experience who could fill in and do a variety of sports. However, the Pennsylvania native made her big break at Fox when she was forced to fill in for Kristine Leahy on one of the episodes of The Herd with Colin Cowherd.</p><p>Nobody anticipated that she would become a regular fixture on the show. Taylor was then revealed as the moderator for Fox Sport 1’s debate program, Skip and Shannon: Undisputed, after impressing Fox Sports’ executives. Similarly, the show became a big success with fans (and continues to do so) not only due to Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe, two incredibly vibrant characters in the sporting world, but also due to Joy’s commanding presence. Thus, Taylor earned a leading anchor role in one of Fox’s most famous series, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, after excelling in all of her previous roles with the organization. Since then, her stock and popularity have steadily increased. Joy will also debut a new show on Caffeine.tv in 2020, in which she will engage and debate with the viewers about sports and entertainment.</p><h2>Is Joy Taylor dating anyone? Husband & Children</h2><p>Joy was previously married to Richard Giannotti. The pair married in a lavish ceremony in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in February 2016. For those who are unaware, her first husband, Giannotti, was a Los Angeles Angels baseball player. Between 2004 and 2006, he spent the bulk of his career in the minor leagues.</p><p>By the end of his career, Richard had transitioned to Global Wealth Management Sports and Entertainment as a financial advisor. Additionally, the pair met at a business conference, as Richard worked for Global Wealth Management’s Sports and Entertainment division. Their union, however, lasted just a year, as the two divorced in 2017.</p><h2>Was Joy Taylor in a relationship with Earl Watson?</h2><p>Following that, rumours emerged that Taylor was involved in a serious relationship with former NBA point guard Earl Watson. Indeed, the pair became engaged in September 2018. However, just as they did previously, the two lovers called off their engagement in November 2019 for undisclosed reasons. They also purchased a $2.75 million home in Encino, California, in early 2019.</p><p>Earl, likewise, spent thirteen years in the NBA between 2001 and 2014, most notably with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers. Additionally, Watson served as a mentor for the Austin Spurs and Phoenix Suns after his retirement. Nonetheless, based on Taylor’s appearance and personality, we are sure that she will have no trouble finding her next boyfriend.</p><h2>What became of Joy Taylor? Domestic Abuse</h2><p>According to them, it’s more difficult to fall in love again after a traumatic breakup. Simply put, Joy endured a tumultuous friendship that culminated in a traumatic breakup. The FS1 sports anchor revealed how she was victimized by her former husband in an episode of Undisputed. Not to mention that her ex used to assault, choke, and suffocate her, and even hurled Joy down the stairs. Taylor was also repeatedly kicked in the chest and pulled out of the vehicle. Similarly, Taylor shared this depressing tale in September 2017; at the time, the whole country was discussing domestic abuse.</p><p>TMZ also released a video of Ray Rice hitting his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, in the face at that time. This incident and the subsequent increase in debate on the subject resulted in the NFL star’s indefinite suspension. Having said that, Joy has yet to disclose the identity of her abuser. As a result, we think he is someone from her previous relationship prior to achieving celebrity status.</p><h2>Presence on Social Media</h2><p>Joy Taylor, a well-known television host and personality, is also involved on social media. Joy updates her social media accounts often and uses them to promote news. At the moment, she has over 200k Instagram and Twitter followers. Similarly, she has a YouTube channel of over 22,000 subscribers. In addition to her hard work, Taylor features vlogs and heart-to-heart conversations about a variety of subjects.
