<time>23 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It's extremely rare to hear a male rapper discuss their struggle with mental illness. Despite that, rap has never been an art form to shy away from the deeply raw thoughts and feelings spewed by those behind the mic.</p><p>Many of our favourite artists have rhymed about lost lovers, friends and tumultuous family relationships. But what we don't tend to hear as much of&nbsp;are mainstream hip-hop artists revealing struggles with mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of October,<a href=#> hip-hop artist Kid Cudi</a> took to social media – writing an <a href=#>open letter to his fans</a> about his battles with mental health problems. He explained that he had admitted himself to rehab for “depression and suicidal urges”, while also referring to himself as “a damaged human”. Throughout the years, these overwhelming difficulties have left him unable to establish new relationships or leave his house for extended periods of time, let alone tour and promote his forthcoming album.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Kid Cudi recently revealed he has admitted himself to rehab</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: AP</span></figure><p>Cudi, real name Scott Mescudi, has seen a tremendous amount of support online since posting the message, and inundated with positive encouragement from both fans and those within the music industry. However, on Sunday 23rd&nbsp;October, rapper and singer Drake released a new track, reportedly mocking Mescudi’s mental health, in reply to a disparaging comment Cudi made about the rapper earlier in the year.</p><p>In the song <a href=#>‘Two Birds, One Stone’,</a> Drake raps that Cudi is simply going through “phases”, refers to the latter as “angry”, while also needing to stay “xanned and perked up” (referring to the prescription drugs Xanax and Percoset, used to treat anxiety and panic attacks), so that he doesn’t have to face reality.</p><p>As someone who has personally battled mental health problems like Cudi’s, Drake’s words are disheartening, and yet entirely expected. Having your mental state used against you is something all too familiar for me. In addition, I’ve been on the receiving end of many conversations from those who don’t understand the severity of such issues, often describing such feelings as fleeting, or that I should just “snap out of it”.</p><p>That said,&nbsp;although the words themselves aren’t surprising, who they’re coming from certainly is. Drake would’ve been my last choice if I were asked to choose who I thought would make light of such a dark situation. I would presume that a man who’s been the subject of a bubbling cauldron overflowing with <a href=#>news articles</a>, memes and <a href=#>parody Twitter accounts</a> dedicated to his apparent over-sensitivity would be slightly more, well…sensitive.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Drake, who had thus far built a reputation for sensitivity</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Steve Marcus</span></figure><p>Perhaps that just shows how common his dismissive attitude is.&nbsp;Although the motion to get men to speak up about their mental struggles has picked up profusely over the last few years, suicide is still the biggest killer of adult men in the UK. According to Samaritans' most recent annual report, <a href=#>over three times as many men committed suicide in 2014 than women</a>. Sentiments such as Drake’s, and similarly undermining words do nothing but harm for so many.</p><p>What's more,&nbsp;Drake’s tasteless dig has shone a light on how mental illness is often perceived within the black community. According Lambeth Labour councillor Ed Davie, “<a href=#>black men in the UK are 17 times more likely than white counterparts to be diagnosed with a psychotic illness</a>.”</p><p>Darryl MacDaniel’s of Run DMC (someone who has been deeply affected by depression and alcoholism) <a href=#>explained</a> in July that depression is “a problem with men but even more for black men…in all of our cultures, there’s stupid things that us men do because we think it’s the masculine man thing to do, not realizing we are destroying our very universe.”</p><p>The subject has even found its way to scripted television, with popular shows from across the pond such as<a href=#> Empire</a> tackling similar themes. One of the shows principal characters, Andre – a successful young black music exec&nbsp;–&nbsp;was diagnosed as bipolar in the show’s first season. He found himself initially unsupported by his father, refusing to accept the diagnosis, while the character’s mother dismissed it as a “white people’s” problem. As ridiculous as it sounds, this isn’t an uncommon way of thinking for many.</p><p>Drake’s words represent the opinions of many. He, along with many others, need to be a lot smarter when it comes to the way they think about mental illness. Suffering from anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts doesn’t make you weak. It’s just wholly disappointing that even a rapper from Toronto who’s been referred to as “emo” by <a href=#>Lorde </a>isn’t immune to mocking someone’s mental health struggles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKWVo3y1tMinoqKml2K6orqOrZ%2BeZaOau7S106KtnmWilr2xsdFmm6uZm5rAbq%2FRrpylZZGpwaKvymamp2WbnrFur9SdoKxlnZq7ta3LZp%2BemV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-sensitive-rapper-drakes-cruel-attack-on-kid-cudis-mental-hea.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-sensitive-rapper-drakes-cruel-attack-on-kid-cudis-mental-hea.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-sensitive-rapper-drakes-cruel-attack-on-kid-cudis-mental-hea.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-sensitive-rapper-drakes-cruel-attack-on-kid-cudis-mental-hea.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-sensitive-rapper-drakes-cruel-attack-on-kid-cudis-mental-hea.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-sensitive-rapper-drakes-cruel-attack-on-kid-cudis-mental-hea.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-radio-ga-ga-by-queen-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-radio-ga-ga-by-queen-2.html>The Meaning Behind The Song: Radio Ga Ga by Queen</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nvidias-geforce-gtx-570-filling-in-the-gaps.html>Power, Temperature, &amp;amp; Noise - NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 570: Filling In The Gaps</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nvidias-geforce-gtx-570-filling-in-the-gaps.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
