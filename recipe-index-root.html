When I first started making them, I couldn’t believe it, because I always thought eggs were essential for really puffy pancakes. But this vegan pancakes recipe proves that you don’t need eggs, or even a common egg substitute like mashed banana or flax, to make an ultra-fluffy stack of pancakes. In this recipe, baking powder and apple cider vinegar are the secret ingredients that help the pancakes puff.

I started making them when I was testing this air fryer buffalo cauliflower recipe and had lots of leftover buffalo cauliflower wings on hand. To make them a meal, I stuffed them into corn tortillas with crisp cabbage, creamy avocado, cilantro, and jalapeños. Then, I added a drizzle of vegan ranch to take it all over the top.

I based this recipe on the baked buffalo cauliflower I shared last fall. After I posted it, I heard from so many of you asking for an air fryer version.

My husband Jack LOVES mushrooms, and I love making risotto for date nights. They’re those rare occasions when you actually want to stand at the stove, stirring and stirring and stirring, because you’re also spending time with someone you love. The fact that all that stirring results in a comforting, flavorful meal is just the cherry on top. Realistically, we probably won’t make this mushroom risotto for Valentine’s Day this year (thinking it would be hard to pull off with a toddler running around!).

It’s budget-friendly, easy to make, and comforting in the way that only pasta with red sauce can be. Though this lentil pasta recipe is full of Italian flavors (marinara! balsamic! Parmesan!), it’s not a take on any specific Italian pasta dish. Rather, it’s something I love to cook when I want a hearty, flavorful pasta dinner, but I don’t&nbsp;want to go to the store or spend hours in the kitchen.

He makes one so often that we have a dedicated grilled cheese pan in our kitchen. It’s seen a million grilled cheese experiments in its day–mayo on the bread, or softened butter? American cheese or Swiss?–all of which have helped him work out what, in our opinion, is THE BEST grilled cheese recipe. It’s incredibly simple, but it yields an undeniably crave-able sandwich. This grilled cheese is crisp and golden on the outside and deliciously melty in the middle (see that cheese pull up there?!).

A fried egg might stick to the pan, it might come out closer to over-hard than over-easy, or–worst of all–its yolk might break as you attempt to flip it. I’ve made ALL these mistakes over the years. While they were disappointing in the moment, they paid off in the long run. Each one taught me a valuable lesson about how to fry an egg, and over time, I’ve worked out a foolproof fried egg recipe, which I’m sharing below.
