Barry grew up in a tough environment, which led him to become involved in street fighting and other forms of delinquent behavior.</p><p>As a teenager, Barry was spotted by a casting director while he was hanging out on the streets with his friends. This chance encounter led to his first acting job in the Irish crime drama, “Love/Hate,” where he played the role of a violent gang member named Wayne. This breakthrough role earned Barry critical acclaim and helped him establish himself as one of the rising stars of Irish cinema.</p><p>After the success of “Love/Hate,” Barry landed roles in several other Irish productions, including the TV series “Fair City” and the film “Stalker.” In 2016, he gained international recognition for his role in the critically acclaimed film “Mammal,” where he played the troubled teenage son of Rachel Griffiths’ character. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was highly praised by critics.</p><p>Barry’s breakthrough role in international cinema came in 2017 when he starred in Christopher Nolan’s epic war film, “Dunkirk.” He played the role of George, a young soldier who becomes stranded on a sinking ship during the evacuation of Dunkirk. His performance in the film was highly praised, and it helped establish him as one of the most promising actors of his generation.</p><p>Following his success in “Dunkirk,” Barry went on to land roles in several other high-profile films, including “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “American Animals.” In “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” Barry played the role of Martin, a disturbed teenager who seeks revenge on the surgeon who accidentally killed his father. The film was well received by critics and earned Barry several award nominations, including a BAFTA Rising Star nomination.</p><p>In “American Animals,” Barry played the role of Spencer Reinhard, one of the four college students who plan a rare book heist at their university. The film was directed by Bart Layton and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018. Barry’s performance in the film was praised by critics, and it earned him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the British Independent Film Awards.</p><p>In 2019, Barry continued to build his reputation as a versatile actor by playing a wide range of roles. He starred in the crime thriller “The Shadow of Violence,” where he played the role of Douglas ‘Arm’ Armstrong, a former boxer who becomes enmeshed in a violent feud. He also appeared in the HBO series “Chernobyl,” where he played the role of Pavel, a young soldier tasked with cleaning up the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p>Barry’s most recent project is the crime drama “Calm with Horses,” which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2019. In the film, he plays the role of Dympna Devers, a member of an Irish crime family who must navigate the dangerous and complicated world of organized crime.</p><p>Barry’s talent and hard work have earned him critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base. He has been recognized for his acting abilities with nominations for various awards, including the BAFTA Rising Star Award, the British Independent Film Award, and the Irish Film and Television Award.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, Barry is also involved in philanthropic work.
