So, how did he win season 25?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Jag, a 25-year-old truck company owner from Omak, Washington, entered the abode on day 1 fueled with the desire to become the first-ever Sikh Big Brother champion. Standing in his way were 16 other houseguests with their own dream of host Julien Chen Moonves announcing them as the CBS flagship series’ newest champion.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>There was a lot of pre-season hype encircling Jag from the Big Brother community. He appeared like a triple threat — social, strategic, and physical — who could either dominate the game, or succumb to an early ousting by not managing his threat level.</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Jag linked up with several of the younger contestants to start the game, including season 25’s first Head of Household, Reilly Smedley, as well as Matt Klotz, and Blue Kim. With Reilly at the helm, the “Family Style” alliance assembled on week 1, which included the four aforementioned names, as well as Cameron Hardin, Jared Fields, America Lopez, and Cory Wurtenberger.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>However, week 2 spelled the end of Reilly’s game. Hisam Goueli, the frontman of the “Professors” alliance, targeted Reilly and never eased up. But, before Reilly was unanimously voted out when she sat beside Cameron on eviction night, Jag returned from the “Nether Region.”</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=105 data-injectable=false>Jared earned the opportunity to save one of his houseguests from the threat of eviction and he chose Jag.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Regardless, Jag had his first interaction with the eviction chair in week 3. After Felicia Cannon — another member of the Professors — ascended the Head of Household throne, Jag was nominated alongside Cameron. Jag went on to win his first competition of the season by capturing the Power of Veto, which worked well for Felicia’s plan as she was targeting Hisam via a backstabbing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">backdoor</a>.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>Jag pulled himself away from the guillotine and Hisam was nominated in his stead. And by the end of the week, Hisam followed Reilly out the door.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Cameron then won the key for the private suite. Although they were linked through the Family Style alliance early on, Cameron nominated Jag and Blue after his trust for them disintegrated and he and his buddy, Red Utley, formed “Legend 25” with Matt, Felicia, Cirie Fields, Izzy Gleicher, Mecole Hayes, and Bowie Jane Ball.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>After losing the Veto competition, Jag received 10 votes for eviction on day 30. If that was a normal night of Big Brother, Jag’s chapter on the reality competition show would’ve closed. But, lucky for Jag, Matt had secretly won the “Power of Invincibility” advantage, which allowed him the opportunity to nullify a player’s demise.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Matt chose to save Jag. So, before Jag was served his walking papers, Julie revealed that his eviction notice had been terminated.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>Well, little did his competitors know, Jag was about to fully embrace his second chance by going on a historic run that netted him the season’s trophy and grand prize.</p><h2 id=h-jag-holds-the-record-for-most-competition-and-power-of-veto-wins-in-big-brother-us-history-while-realizing-his-dream data-injectable=false>Jag holds the record for most competition and Power of Veto wins in Big Brother US history while realizing his dream</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Well, Jag’s new lease on life didn’t begin with a bang. During week 5, Jared nominated him to sit beside Red after Cameron donned the golden Veto necklace. Red was eventually blindsided with eight votes while Jag caught two (from Bowie Jane and Cameron).</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Day 37 marked the second straight eviction night Jag starred in. He was a nominee in three of the five weeks which was fueled by his inability to trust the right people with the right information.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>But, remarkably, that was the last time Jag found himself on the chopping block.</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Cameron notched his second Head of Household in week 6, and he avenged Red by nominating Felicia and Izzy. In a plan streamlined by America and Cory, the house flipped on Izzy, and the professional flutist was ousted from the game.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>The house’s power structure had another reshuffling the next week when Cameron and Jared fell in the season’s first double eviction. Like the man he was charged with evicting in week 4, Cameron found a way to extend his game’s life in week 8 by winning the zombie battle-back series against Jared.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>With Jared and Izzy out of the house and Cameron aligning himself with Jag and Matt as “The Fugitives,” Jag found himself in the best position he had been in for weeks. Week 9 featured Cameron winning his third Head of Household, which led to Mecole’s time in the house coming to a close.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Week 10 is when Jag’s game truly ramped up. Cameron had firmly established himself as the biggest competition threat in the house — a position Jag took over once Cameron exited the house for the final time in week 11 courtesy of Bowie Jane’s Head of Household reign.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Jag was all in on tossing out Cameron and the Fugitive alliance in favor of working closely with Bowie Jane and Matt. And just like he had in week 7, Jag won the Veto competition that directly led to Cameron’s eviction.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>With Cameron off the board and Jag, Bowie Jane, and Matt’s trio alliance in full swing, Jag began his Big Brother competition domination, and “The Mafia” started eliminating players one after the other. In week 11, Jag won both the invisible Head of Household and Power of Veto, and Cory joined Cameron in the Jury house.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Because of the invisibility twist, Jag was eligible to compete in the next Head of Household competition — which he won. Although they started the game as each other’s closest allies, Jag took a direct shot a Blue and didn’t miss after also nabbing the Veto. Blue’s exit marked the start of the second double eviction, and after Bowie Jane won Head of Household and Matt secured the Veto, America was voted out.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Week 13 began with Matt following up his Veto victory by moving into the private suite. At this point in the game, all who stood in front of The Mafia’s final three campaign was Cirie and Felicia — the season’s two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">oldest houseguests</a>.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>However, Jag knew Matt was close with Cirie, and he worked his magic to convince the 27-year-old Deaflympics gold medalist to nominate Cirie beside Felicia. Jag then went on to win the Power Veto while also secretly making a secret final two deal with Bowie Jane.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Safe from eviction, Jag and Bowie Jane cut Cirie. What followed was a Bowie Jane Head of Household and Jag Power of Veto win, and with the sole eviction vote, Jag chose to stay loyal to Matt and eliminate Felicia.</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>Jag’s Mafia crew were the only players remaining on day 96. And with Bowie Jane and Matt both pledging to take him to the final two, Jag’s odds of winning were at an all-time high. Matt won the first part of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three-part final Head of Household</a>, and Jag beat Bowie Jane in part two, setting up a showdown with his “Minutemen” ally on finale night. The two duked it out on day 100 during the live episode, and Jag broke the Big Brother US record for most competition wins in a single season by defeating Matt in a tiebreaker.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>Faced with the toughest decision of his reality show career, Jag picked Matt — the man who saved him in week 4 — over Bowie Jane. She walked out the front door and rounded out the Jury.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>As they were the last two houseguests remaining, Jag and Matt addressed the seven evictees. The two fielded the Jury’s questions with Jag having the clear edge over Matt in terms of answers.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Jag passionately owned his backstabbing and betraying with well-rehearsed and direct responses. On the other end, Matt’s answers left a lot to be desired, and he leaned more into his partnership with Jag instead of explaining the moves he made independent of his other Minuteman.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>On the other end, Jag sold that he was the mastermind of the duo — and the Jury awarded that. Jag received five votes to win from the Jury (Felicia and Cirie voted for Matt), and he became the first-ever Sikh Big Brother winner.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>As mentioned, Jag’s 10 competition wins are the most a player has garnered in a single season of Big Brother’s U.S. version. Further, Jag <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set the record</a> for most Power of Veto victories. Jag snagged seven necklaces, dethroning Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina and Big Brother 24’s Michael Bruner, who both won six in a season.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>Jag’s also the only player to be evicted and win the same season — the cherry on top of his storied Big Brother 25 triumph.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjtcZmmaunpJ2ys3mRbmShp6disaqwjKOYoGWSlravv4ywoKdlpJ2ybr7EmqOirKlisLC5z56roqyZpLtuv8eormg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-brother-25-how-did-jag-bains-win-the-reality-competition-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbig-brother-25-how-did-jag-bains-win-the-reality-competition-show.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbig-brother-25-how-did-jag-bains-win-the-reality-competition-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbig-brother-25-how-did-jag-bains-win-the-reality-competition-show.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-brother-25-how-did-jag-bains-win-the-reality-competition-show.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-brother-25-how-did-jag-bains-win-the-reality-competition-show.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./can-slotted-brake-rotors-be-resurfaced-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./can-slotted-brake-rotors-be-resurfaced-html.html>Can slotted brake rotors be resurfaced?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./becky-lynch-advocates-seth-rollins-as-the-better-opponent-for-cody-rhodes-at-wrestlemania-40.html>Becky Lynch Advocates Seth Rollins As The Better Opponent For Cody Rhodes At WrestleMania 40</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./becky-lynch-advocates-seth-rollins-as-the-better-opponent-for-cody-rhodes-at-wrestlemania-40.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
