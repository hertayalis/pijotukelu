It's something my mom and dad played both growing up."</p><p>Their father was a Division II basketball player for Nova Southeastern in Florida, and despite trying almost every sport under the sun, the girls would always return to the court together.</p><p>"When we grew up, we played it only together. That's kind of what we knew," Haley adds. "So that was always a dream."</p><p>Now, the pair are on the Fresno State women's basketball team and share highlights of their skills on their <a href=#>TikTok</a> account, @cavindertwins, where they have 4.5 million followers. But who are Haley and Hanna off the court? Distractify spoke exclusively with the twins to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many Cavinder siblings are there?</h2><p>While Haley and Hanna have 4.5 million followers on their TikTok, they're also full-time athletes and students ‚Äî so they said their older sister, Brooke, helps with many of the managerial duties that come with their platform.</p><p>"[Our] main [focus] is basketball and education," Hanna explains. "So just having a team behind you and not having to worry about every little thing. And obviously having people that you can trust."</p><p>Brooke is also on TikTok and often makes videos with her twin younger sisters. Her account is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@brookecavinder</a>, and while you won't find basketball content on her page, you will find a lot of dancing and charcuterie boards.</p><p>Luckily, these girls have a strong supporting team behind them, both on and off the court, and their love of making content continues to propel them forward in an otherwise very stressful situation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a><p>Haley, Brooke, and Hanna Cavinder</p></figure><p>"Hanna and I just, like, love YouTube and TikTok, being able to share our life online," Haley says.

They're the first NCAA athletes to get a brand partnership.</h2><p><a href=#>NCAA</a> student-athletes have long battled to own the rights to their name, image, and likeness when it came to brand partnerships. At the end of June 2021, the NCAA officially allowed its athletes to receive financial compensation while competing with new NIL rules, and the Cavinder twins were the first to sign a brand partnership with Boost Mobile.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cavindertwins href=#>@cavindertwins</a><p>wait for the surprise <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=bball href=#>#bball</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ The Chicken Wing Beat - Ricky Desktop" href=#>‚ô¨ The Chicken Wing Beat - Ricky Desktop</a></figure><p>The pair said they were thrilled to partner with the company when it was offered, though it doesn't change their platform's future plans. In fact, they aren't focused too much on what's next for them, and say they just plan to take it all "day by day."</p><p>"I think Hanna and I are just going to take it day-by-day," Haley says. "We don't have many expectations for our social media presence. Just because we never expected this in the first place."</p><p>Their shared dream was to be able to play basketball together in college ‚Äî and as long as they're still playing together, they're not worried about the rest.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cavindertwins href=#>@cavindertwins</a><p>we luv this dance <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=twins href=#>#twins</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ CAUSE IS BEAT THAT BOY WIT A BAT - ‚ñ´Ô∏èùôéùôÆùô•ùôùùôöùôß‚ñ´Ô∏è" href=#>‚ô¨ CAUSE IS BEAT THAT BOY WIT A BAT - ‚ñ´Ô∏èùôéùôÆùô•ùôùùôöùôß‚ñ´Ô∏è</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">After Miami lost to Louisiana, the Cavinder twins stunned in this new TikTok dance video.</h2><p>Even when they aren't scoring together on the court, Hanna and Haley are still winning on TikTok. Case-in-point: one of their most recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">videos</a> in which the dynamic duo danced in their bikinis to a popular sound byte. After Louisiana State University beat the University of Miami in the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament, the two shared a few TikTok videos, but this one in particular proves they're willing to move beyond the loss and roll into the summer in style.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecCrnGabkau2r7DEq2Str5mjwG7AyKSrqKM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-cavinder-twins-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-cavinder-twins-tiktok.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-cavinder-twins-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-cavinder-twins-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-cavinder-twins-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-cavinder-twins-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mariah-carey-felt-working-whitney-houston-the-prince-of-egypt-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mariah-carey-felt-working-whitney-houston-the-prince-of-egypt-html.html>How Mariah Carey Felt About Working With Whitney Houston for 'The Prince of Egypt'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gaege-gibson-html.html>Gaege Gibson - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gaege-gibson-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
