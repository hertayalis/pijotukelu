Less than an hour later, she then heard another loud noise coming from the apartment and looked out her window to see the same man jumping from DelVesco's balcony.</p><p>This time, she also saw smoke and quickly called 911 again.</p><p>“I just called the cops about a girl screaming and I just saw the guy who was in there run out of her room and it looks like her room is on fire,” Muhr told the operator, according to a transcript of the call obtained by CNN.</p><p>Again, authorities rushed to the scene but this time, they found DelVesco's body badly burned on her bed.</p><p>Police documents showed that she was initially labeled a "Jane Doe" before dental records positively IDed her, according to CNN.</p><p>Her autopsy later revealed <a href=#>low levels of carbon monoxide</a> in her blood and the absence of soot in her lungs, meaning that DelVesco “was most likely deceased prior to ignition of the residential fire."</p><h2>Who killed Andrea DelVesco?</h2><p>After DelVesco's body was discovered police launched an investigation to try and find her killer.</p><p>The investigation eventually led to the arrests of two college students, Alberto Medina and Eric Marquez.</p><p>Medina, a <a href=#>Fresno State University</a> student, was later found guilty of murder, arson, burglary, and animal cruelty in connection with DelVesco’s death, according to the <a href=# aria-label="Los Angeles Times (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Times</a>. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/alberto-medina-25-shown-listening-786338117.jpg><p>Marquez, a UCLA student who lived across the street from DelVesco, also pleaded guilty to one burglary count and a count of being an accessory after the fact. He was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison in 2018.</p><p>The LAPD also faced backlash from DelVesco's murder because of their response to the initial 911 call. As a result, veteran officers Rhoadell Sudduth and Alisha Williams were fired, according to <a href=# aria-label="CBS News (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a>.</p><p>“If they had gone into the apartment, maybe Andrea would be alive today,” DelVesco's mother, Leslie, said in a statement, via CBS News.</p><p>“It astounds me and horrifies me that the police could have left and not made sure that all the girls in the apartment were OK.</p><p>“We’ll never know if when they responded to the initial 911 call if Andrea was alive or not. But we do know that the fire hadn’t been set then. So no matter what, we could have seen Andrea as we remembered her before her body was so badly burned,” she added.</p><p>The LAPD also released a statement saying: "The facts and circumstances surrounding the murder of Andrea DelVesco earlier this year was a devastating and unspeakable tragedy for her family, friends, the community, and the men and women of the LAPD.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"We cannot fully comprehend the grief her parents and other loved ones have suffered from their loss and the senior detectives from LAPD’s Robbery Homicide Division worked tirelessly to identify and arrest Andrea’s suspected murderers so that they may face justice.</p><p>"As additional details were discovered about the circumstances of the incident, the LAPD took swift action to hold Department personnel accountable for mistakes made in the initial stages of the investigation."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdnZYJ0hZBsZrCgn2Kur7DRnphmnJWhw6a%2FwqhksKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-andrea-delvesco-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-andrea-delvesco-what-happened.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-andrea-delvesco-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-andrea-delvesco-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-andrea-delvesco-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-andrea-delvesco-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./adele-reveals-how-rich-paul-drives-her-insane-amid-private-wedding.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./adele-reveals-how-rich-paul-drives-her-insane-amid-private-wedding.html>Adele reveals how Rich Paul 'drives me insane' amid reported private wedding</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cast-resident-evil-really-look.html>What The Cast Of Resident Evil Should Really Look Like</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cast-resident-evil-really-look.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
