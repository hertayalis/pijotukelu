<time>05 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div></header><p>９０年代にインディーズ業界、
及びにヴィジュアル系に革命を起こして、
伝説的バンドであるmalice mizer。
GACKTさんをボーカルに迎えていた時代は、
「これからメジャーで大暴れする！」と、
多くのファンが期待し、malice mizerの天下を夢見ていたことでしょう。
現在は活動が止まっているものの、
今でも多くの信者を抱え、
リーダーのManaさんを愛してやまない方が多いです。
malice mizerはステージのセットが、インディーズ時代から凝っており、
マナさんが自宅から家具を持ち出すなど、ライブが始まる前の準備に追われていたそうです。
そんなmalice mizerのトレードマークと言えるのが、
中世ヨーロッパの貴族をイメージしたような、
白塗りの人形のようなメイクです。
GACKTさんは王子様なのに対して、
リーダーのマナさんはお姫様のようなメイクをしていました。
今となって気になるのは、
malice mizerのメンバーのすっぴん、
特に一際美しかったマナさんのすっぴんですね。
malice mizerのManaのすっぴん。画像はない malice mizerのメンバーは、
ライブ以外のメディア活動でも、
濃い白塗りのメイクを施してました。
「笑っていいとも!」に出演した際にも、
濃いメイクでタモリさんを驚かせていました。
しかし、脱退したメンバーのテツさんは、
他の活動で堂々とすっぴんで活動していたり、
GACKTさんも、時よりすっぴんに近い姿を公開してます。
それでも、一番すっぴんが気になる、
リーダーのマナさんのすっぴんは一切公開されていません。
マナさんは、今の別の活動の中でも、
きっちとメイクを施しており、
ヴィジュアル的には全盛期と変わらない完成度を維持してます。
どこにもマナさんのすっぴんの画像はない・・・、
だとしても、過去のmalice mizer関連の本の中で、
インタビュアーがメンバーのすっぴんを見た感想などはあります。
malice mizerはメンバー全員が、
もともと男前で、すっぴんでも全然いけるバンドなのです。
特にマナさんとGACKTさんは、
顔の輪郭から目鼻の作りまで、
メイクをしてなくても整ってのはわかります。
これからマナさんのすっぴんを見てる機会来るのか・・・？
現在の年齢はいくつになるのでしょうか？
GACKTさんが既に４０歳を超えているので、マナさんもなかなかです。
今後、幾つになってもメイクをして活動を続けていくのか、
それとも、どこかですっぴんを公開する機会が訪れるのか、
今後もマナさんの動向には目が離せません！
malice mizerのkamiの生年月日と命日(お墓) malice mizer最大の悲劇といえば、
全盛期でのボーカルのGACKTさんの脱退です。
そして、その次に悲劇的だと言えるのが、
全盛期のドラマのkamiの死去です。
malice mizerの正規ドラマーとして活躍していたkamiさんですが、
１９９９年の６月２１日にくも膜下出血で急死し、
バンドに大きな大打撃を与えました。
今となって言えるkamiさんの生年月日ですが、</p><footer><a href=../../post-4265.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../romeo-santos-net-worth-2024-2.html>Romeo Santos Net Worth 2024</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

Shark attacks typically happen near the shore, in surf zones, or near a sandbar. Should a shark attack happens, it likely mistook you for a tasty seal. Because of this, it's best to frequently change direction while swimming to appear less like prey, and avoid contrasting colors which can sometimes catch a shark's attention. Never swim while bleeding, and staying away from murky water in high-risk areas are also both recommended.</p><footer><a href=../../expert-reveals-what-you-need-to-do-if-youre-attacked-by-a-shark-exclusive.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../ibuypower-battalion-m1771-msi-gs70-gaming-notebook-review.html>iBuyPower Battalion M1771 (MSI GS70) Gaming Notebook Review</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

Yes, slotted rotors may be resurfaced; however, you must locate a shop that will do this service since there aren’t many of them.
Also, can you resurface rotors that have been drilled and slotted? If you want to prevent chatter, just set your brake lathe to the slowest setting it has.

In fact, some people feel strongly that October Scorpios and November Scorpios may as well be two totally different breeds of stinger-slinging arachnids. Every astrology chart is one-of-a-kind and our planetary placements will vary based on the day, year, and even minute that we’re born — so it makes sense that not every Scorpio will have a similar personality.</p><footer><a href=../../biggest-differences-between-october-november-scorpios-astrologer.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../the-wheel-of-time-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html>The Wheel of Time cast, ranked by net worth</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

Spoiler alert: This article contains minor spoilers for Zoey 102.
15 years after the Zoey 101 finale aired on Nickelodeon, Zoey 102 is here to fulfill all our teenage fantasies. We all thought Chase (Sean Flynn) and Zoey (Jamie Lynn Spears) were endgame, but apparently, they didn’t *actually* get together at the end of their Pacific Coast Academy careers.</p><footer><a href=../../what-happened-in-hawaii-zoey-101.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../wout-van-aert.html>Wout van Aert</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
