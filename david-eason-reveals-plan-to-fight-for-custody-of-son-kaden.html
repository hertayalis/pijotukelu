His&nbsp; mother is on drugs and has kept him from me for a long time trying to hide her bad habits,”</p><p>Recently, David posted pictures to his Instagram story with the caption, “When the best moments are missed for years on end because of a grudge, you know you’re obsessively controlling!”</p><p><a href=#>The Sun</a> reported he wrote an additional post that read, “Just a few more months and I will have my son back in my arms!&nbsp; It’s been too long!&nbsp; I never knew anyone could be so cold hearted to alienate my son from me but the truth always comes out and justice prevails!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/David-Eason.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/David-Eason-2.jpg><h2>David’s troubled past</h2><p>David’s ex-girlfriend Olivia has worried in the past about Kaden being around David’s volatile behavior.&nbsp; David’s temper has landed him in several different troublesome situations.</p><p>Last October, Teen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans filed a protective order against David in order to protect herself and her children.</p><p>According to <a href=#>E! News</a>, Jenelle cited various incidents of alleged abuse and claimed she was scared for the safety of herself and for her children.&nbsp; She stated in court documents, “Because of his recent threats, his history of violence, his erratic behavior and his large stockpile of weapons, I am scared for my life and my children’s well-being.”</p><p>Jenelle also claimed David threatened her and said, “You can die for all I care. You’re a piece of s**t. Biggest piece of s**t I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Eventually, Jenelle wanted the order dropped as she and David sought out couples counseling and made amends.</p><p data-pw-in-article=true>Following the issue with the protective order, David was arrested and faced felony assault charges for <a href=#>pistol-whipping one of Jenelle’s friends</a>&nbsp;when he came with her to pick up some of her belongings from their home.</p><p data-pw-in-article=true>Despite yet another act of violence, Jenelle once again made up with David and continued their relationship.</p><h2>Jenelle fired from MTV because of David</h2><p>David’s violent track record eventually got Jenelle fired from the Teen Mom 2 franchise after <a href=#>he shot and killed their family dog.</a></p><p>MTV released the statement, “MTV ended its relationship with David Eason over a year ago in February 2018 and has not filmed any new episodes of Teen Mom 2 with him since. Additionally, we have stopped filming with Jenelle Eason as of April 6, 2019, and have no plans to cover her story in the upcoming season.”</p><p>David defended his actions and claimed he shot the dog in order to protect their daughter Ensley.&nbsp; The dog reportedly bit her in the face and David felt the dog could never be trusted around his children again.</p><p>David fears for Kaden’s safety with his mother Olivia, yet he himself has a lengthy history of alleged violence.&nbsp; As David seeks full custody of his son, it’s unclear how his violent past will affect his case.</p><p>Teen Mom 2 airs Tuesdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5SWw6qwjJ6YrKeeYr%2BmwsSao6xloKGur3nTqGSfoZedwW6yzqtknK2jqbylxYyonWarn6N6rK3DnqVo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-eason-reveals-plan-to-fight-for-custody-of-son-kaden.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdavid-eason-reveals-plan-to-fight-for-custody-of-son-kaden.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdavid-eason-reveals-plan-to-fight-for-custody-of-son-kaden.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdavid-eason-reveals-plan-to-fight-for-custody-of-son-kaden.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-eason-reveals-plan-to-fight-for-custody-of-son-kaden.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-eason-reveals-plan-to-fight-for-custody-of-son-kaden.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dick-sheridan-nc-state-and-dick-sheridan-obituary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dick-sheridan-nc-state-and-dick-sheridan-obituary.html>dick sheridan nc state and dick sheridan obituary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./can-you-reverse-gray-hair-8607963.html>Can You Reverse Gray Hair?
