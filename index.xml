Fans were overjoyed when both Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke were added to the Marvel universe, hoping for big things from both of them. While theories might’ve been way off — Clarke didn’t turn out to be Abigail Brand, for instance — thankfully the Secret Invasion finale leaves the door open for more from both of them.</description></item><item><title>Naomi Watts Wore the Comfy Heels I Walked, Ran, and Danced in for 12+ Hours</title><link>/look-of-the-day-2024-01-24-8549239.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/look-of-the-day-2024-01-24-8549239.html</guid><description>Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve been obsessed with heels, and a photograph of a 5-year-old me wearing my mom’s soaring tall boots proves that.

及びにヴィジュアル系に革命を起こして、
伝説的バンドであるmalice mizer。
GACKTさんをボーカルに迎えていた時代は、
「これからメジャーで大暴れする！」と、
多くのファンが期待し、malice mizerの天下を夢見ていたことでしょう。
現在は活動が止まっているものの、
今でも多くの信者を抱え、
リーダーのManaさんを愛してやまない方が多いです。
malice mizerはステージのセットが、インディーズ時代から凝っており、
マナさんが自宅から家具を持ち出すなど、ライブが始まる前の準備に追われていたそうです。
そんなmalice mizerのトレードマークと言えるのが、
中世ヨーロッパの貴族をイメージしたような、
白塗りの人形のようなメイクです。
GACKTさんは王子様なのに対して、
リーダーのマナさんはお姫様のようなメイクをしていました。
今となって気になるのは、
malice mizerのメンバーのすっぴん、
特に一際美しかったマナさんのすっぴんですね。
malice mizerのManaのすっぴん。画像はない malice mizerのメンバーは、
ライブ以外のメディア活動でも、
濃い白塗りのメイクを施してました。
「笑っていいとも!」に出演した際にも、
濃いメイクでタモリさんを驚かせていました。
しかし、脱退したメンバーのテツさんは、
他の活動で堂々とすっぴんで活動していたり、
GACKTさんも、時よりすっぴんに近い姿を公開してます。
それでも、一番すっぴんが気になる、
リーダーのマナさんのすっぴんは一切公開されていません。
マナさんは、今の別の活動の中でも、
きっちとメイクを施しており、
ヴィジュアル的には全盛期と変わらない完成度を維持してます。
どこにもマナさんのすっぴんの画像はない・・・、
だとしても、過去のmalice mizer関連の本の中で、
インタビュアーがメンバーのすっぴんを見た感想などはあります。
malice mizerはメンバー全員が、
もともと男前で、すっぴんでも全然いけるバンドなのです。
特にマナさんとGACKTさんは、
顔の輪郭から目鼻の作りまで、
メイクをしてなくても整ってのはわかります。
これからマナさんのすっぴんを見てる機会来るのか・・・？
現在の年齢はいくつになるのでしょうか？
GACKTさんが既に４０歳を超えているので、マナさんもなかなかです。
今後、幾つになってもメイクをして活動を続けていくのか、
それとも、どこかですっぴんを公開する機会が訪れるのか、
今後もマナさんの動向には目が離せません！
malice mizerのkamiの生年月日と命日(お墓) malice mizer最大の悲劇といえば、
全盛期でのボーカルのGACKTさんの脱退です。
そして、その次に悲劇的だと言えるのが、
全盛期のドラマのkamiの死去です。
malice mizerの正規ドラマーとして活躍していたkamiさんですが、
１９９９年の６月２１日にくも膜下出血で急死し、
バンドに大きな大打撃を与えました。
今となって言えるkamiさんの生年月日ですが、</description></item><item><title>Romeo Santos Net Worth 2024</title><link>/romeo-santos-net-worth-2024-2.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/romeo-santos-net-worth-2024-2.html</guid><description>Romeo Santos, the King of Bachata, has been serenading the world with his melodious voice and heart-wrenching lyrics for over two decades.

Typically this test is memory bandwidth bound as the nature of the test has the ROPs pushing as many pixels as possible with as little overhead as possible, which in turn shifts the bottleneck to a mix of ROP performance and the memory bandwidth needed to feed those ROPs.</description></item><item><title>The 10 best Orange Is the New Black rivalries, ranked</title><link>/the-10-best-orange-is-the-new-black-rivalries-ranked.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-10-best-orange-is-the-new-black-rivalries-ranked.html</guid><description>We’ve ranked the relationships, we’ve ranked the friendships, so now it’s time to rank the rivalries — of which there are many — from Netflix’s hit comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black.

Shark attacks typically happen near the shore, in surf zones, or near a sandbar. Should a shark attack happens, it likely mistook you for a tasty seal. Because of this, it's best to frequently change direction while swimming to appear less like prey, and avoid contrasting colors which can sometimes catch a shark's attention. Never swim while bleeding, and staying away from murky water in high-risk areas are also both recommended.</description></item><item><title>iBuyPower Battalion M1771 (MSI GS70) Gaming Notebook Review</title><link>/ibuypower-battalion-m1771-msi-gs70-gaming-notebook-review.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ibuypower-battalion-m1771-msi-gs70-gaming-notebook-review.html</guid><description>MSI is taking a page out of Razer's design playbook (in turn cribbing liberally from Apple's), but as it turns out, they may have beaten Razer at their own game and produced both a more desirable and more affordable Blade. iBuyPower sent over their version of MSI's GS70, dubbed the Battalion M1771, and it's an almost surprisingly fantastic piece of gaming kit.
